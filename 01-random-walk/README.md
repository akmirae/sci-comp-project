# 01 - Random Walk

This project implements a **2D random walk** simulation using a simple Monte Carlo method. It models multiple entities moving step-by-step in random directions across a bounded grid.

## Description

Each entity starts from a random or fixed position and makes a small movement in a random direction at each time step. Over time, the trace of each entity forms a stochastic path that resembles diffusion or Brownian motion.

This project demonstrates:
- Randomized movement logic
- State updates over time
- Accumulating trajectories (path tracing)
- Simple statistical behavior from many agents

## Controls

The interactive dashboard allows you to:
- Set the number of walkers
- Define the step size and grid boundaries
- Reset and replay the simulation in real time

## Example Use Cases

- Modeling diffusion or gas particle motion
- Teaching stochastic processes and randomness
- Starting point for more complex agent movement behaviors

> This is a great project to understand how randomness produces patterns when repeated many times over.

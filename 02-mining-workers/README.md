# 02-mining-workers

This project simulates a basic mining system. Multiple workers move across a field to gather resources (minerals) and return them to the base. Each worker checks whether it's full, empty, or near a mineral and reacts accordingly.

It demonstrates state-based logic in a simulation environment, and includes a simple decision tree:
- Seek mineral if empty
- Harvest mineral if near one
- Return to base when full

This is an excellent foundation for more complex simulations like resource management games or decentralized swarm behavior.

03 - Resource Growth

This project simulates resource production and consumption dynamics in a simplified environment. It models entities that generate, consume, and possibly deplete shared resources over time.

🚀 Key Concepts
Entities: Autonomous agents that consume or generate resources.

Resource Node: A point in space holding a finite quantity of resources.

Growth Model: Simulates replenishment or depletion depending on configuration.

Consumption Rules: Entities extract resources when nearby; depletion occurs if consumption exceeds growth.

🧠 Educational Purpose
This simulation demonstrates:

Basic resource economy modeling.

Interaction between multiple entities and limited resources.

Environmental feedback loops.

Visualization of extraction behavior in real time.

📊 Visualization Features
Real-time display of entities and resource levels.

Heatmap or color indicators to represent resource density.

Live simulation controls (reset, play, speed adjustment).

🛠️ How to Extend
You can expand the simulation by:

Introducing multiple resource types.

Adding regeneration rules or decay over time.

Assigning agents different strategies or roles (e.g., hoarders vs sharers).

Connecting it with game theory decision-making or AI planning.

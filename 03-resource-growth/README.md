03 - Entity Followers
This project demonstrates simple agent-based simulation where some entities move freely while others follow them. It’s a foundation for more complex multi-agent systems involving attraction, pursuit, or swarming behavior.

👾 What It Does
Spawns two types of entities:

Leaders: Move independently using basic motion rules.

Followers: Constantly chase or follow the nearest leader.

Calculates distances dynamically and updates movement each frame.

Shows how group behavior can emerge from simple rules.

🧠 Educational Focus
This simulation illustrates:

Basic pursuit algorithms.

Distance-based movement.

Real-time coordination of multiple agents.

Concepts behind flocking, crowd behavior, and group dynamics.

📈 Visualization Features
Colored separation between leaders and followers.

Real-time simulation with play/pause/reset controls.

Trailing paths to visualize pursuit history.

🛠️ How to Extend
You can enhance this simulation by:

Introducing avoidance behaviors (to prevent collisions).

Adding randomness or personality to follower behavior.

Implementing flocking algorithms (e.g., Boids).

Allowing dynamic leader switching or multiple targets.

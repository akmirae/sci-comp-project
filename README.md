# Scientific Computing Projects (Spring 2025)

This repository contains nine simulation-based projects developed as part of the Scientific Computing course (Fall 2025). Each project demonstrates a different concept in numerical modeling, simulation, or agent-based behavior using modern C++ and a Python-based interactive dashboard.

## Project Index

| No. | Title                  | Description |
|-----|------------------------|-------------|
| 00  | [Simple Entities](./00-simple-entities) | Basic template for visualizing moving entities with customizable equations. |
| 01  | [Random Walk](./01-random-walk)         | 2D grid-based Monte Carlo simulation of random motion. |
| 02  | [Mining Workers](./02-mining-workers)   | Task-based simulation of workers collecting resources and returning home. |
| 03  | [Entity Followers](./03-entity-followers) | Agents following a leader with proximity-based behavior. |
| 04  | [Dynamic Graphs](./04-dynamic-graphs)   | Graph structure with time-varying edges and force-based layouts. |
| 05  | [Ants and Pheromones](./05-ants-basic)  | Ant colony simulation using pheromone trails and food-seeking behavior. |
| 06  | [Autonomous Defense](./07-auto-defense) | Simulation of radar-based projectile targeting with defense logic. |
| 07  | [N-Body System](./08-n-body-system)     | Gravity-based physics simulation of celestial bodies in 2D space. |
| 08  | [Multi-Agent Planning](./09-task-planning) | Agents with goals navigating toward dynamic targets. |

Each project includes:
- ⚙️ C++ simulation logic
- 📊 Python dashboard (via PyBind11 + Panel)
- 📁 Configurable JSON input
